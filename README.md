## The Story (and Abilities)
Three souls are joined together within a magical artifact in the shape of a mask.  Only one soul can manifest a form at any given time, but each form has a different ability.

Bree is small and can perform a quick horizontal dash.
Ellistair is versatile and can perform a double jump.
Vellsua is large and can perform a devastating ground-pound attack.

The three share a common goal: to stop the Nighthawk from consuming the souls of the innocent and stealing their powers.  Guide the three joined souls to their destination and defeat the Nighthawk before it's too late, learning more about the world and the characters as you travel.

 - Game mechanics fixes (movement and abilities work properly now)
 - Revamped control scheme (see "controls" above)
