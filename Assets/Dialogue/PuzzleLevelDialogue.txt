On the stone is engraved a message...
"Three souls were joined together, bound in a mask-like artifact."
"Each soul manifests a different form, each with a different power."
"Together they fight to restore the lost, and save the souls of the innocent."


The legends speak of a swift young shrike, blue in hue and fierce in spirit.
Her name was Bree, her speed unmatched.  Able to dash through the air and outpace her foes.
She excelled in aerial combat and agility, but was struck down in her recklessness.

Myths tell of a bright owl scholar, yellow in tone and demeanor.
His name was Ellistair, who sought arcane secrets untold but found only ruin.
He flew with his research and reached great heights, but fell to his own lust for knowledge.

Tales have been told of a powerful vulture, purple in color and towering over all.
Her name was Vellsua, a foreigner from afar seeking solace from the past.
She strived for reform, but was haunted and hated by those she left behind.
